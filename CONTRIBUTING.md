- Follow the single-purpose principle: Only one fix or feature in one PR
- Write tests for newly introduced features or fixes
- Apply a proper code style that fits to the existing one
- Do not change the plugin metadata information (e.g. name, version, description, etc.) in _src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml_

### Some guidance for opening an issue

- Follow the single-purpose principle: Only one issue per thread
- For a bug reports:
  - Provide as many detailed information about your setup as possible
  - Point out the expected behavior in comparison with the current behavior
  - If possible, describe the steps on how to reproduce
- For feature requests:
  - Search for duplicates/already existing feature request
  - Describe the wanted feature together with its use case and benefits
  - Provide examples if possible

### Compiling the source code

Since the project has been migrated to the Gradle and [Gradle IntelliJ plugin](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin),
the build process is quite simple. To build the plugin (including tests) just execute:

```
gradle build
```
    
All required dependencies like IntelliJ SDK, Grammar-Kit, etc are downloaded in the background and triggered properly
during the build process. To start an IDE for manual testing, execute:

```
gradle runIdea
```
 
All of the gradle tasks can be connected to the IntelliJ debugger.
